				<h2><li>Short-tailed Albatross</li>
				<center><img src="Images/Albatros.jpg" height="400" width="600" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>Short-tailed Albatross nests primarily on a few islands off the coast of Japan, where it was once known as Ahodori (fool-bird). The nickname derived from the species' naiveté regarding people, which almost led to the extinction of a bird that once numbered in the millions.</p>	
				<li>California Condor</li>
				<center><img src="Images/Condor.jpg" height="400" width="800" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>A California Condor in flight is an impressive sight. With a nine-foot plus wingspan, the birds can stay aloft for hours, floating up to 15,000 feet on warm air thermals.This is North America's largest flying bird, weighing over 20 pounds. Condors can survive up to 60 years in the wild, but don't mature sexually until six or seven years of age and lay only one egg per year. Their slow maturation and reproductive process have been a factor in the bird's decline and near extinction.</p>
				<li>The Least Tern</li>
				<center><img src="Images/Tern.jpg" height="400" width="600" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>The Least Tern has two big problems. It prefers sandy beaches for nesting—the same kinds of places that people love to visit. And, because it nests on the ground, it's vulnerable to attacks by cats, dogs, and other predators, which can destroy a significant portion of a colony's eggs and chicks.</p>
				<li>Piping Plover</li>
				<center><img src="Images/Plover.jpg" height="400" width="600" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>The small, sand-colored Piping Plover, named for its melodic, plaintive whistle, is a bird of beaches and barrier islands, sharing this habitat with Least Terns, Black Skimmers, and Wilson's Plovers.</p>
