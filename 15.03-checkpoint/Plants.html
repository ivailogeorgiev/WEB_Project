				<center><img src="Images/Rafflesia.jpg" height="400" width="600" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>Rafflesia arnoldii is thought to be the largest flower on the planet. The flower itself does not have a structural stem, leaves, or roots. But what it does have is the pungent odors of decomposing flesh, hence the nickname corpse flower. It grows three feet in diameter, and weighs up to 24 pounds. The Rafflesia is parasitic, growing on the Tetrastigma vine in the forests of Borneo and Sumatra. </p>	
				<li>Georgia Aster</li>
				<center><img src="Images/Georgia.jpg" height="600" width="600" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>Symphyotrichum georgianum is native to southeastern United States. According to NatureServe.com, a conservation organization, this plant first grew in small clumps, but now there are about 60 populations of this plant due to natural habitat development. </p>
				<li>Wiggin's Acalypha</li>
				<center><img src="Images/Riggli.jpg" height="400" width="800" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>Acalypha wigginsii is native to a tiny part of the Galapagos Islands. Construction work and loss of habitat are the main reasons these plants have declined in number. They are considered aCritically Endangered by the Galapagos Conservation Trust.</p>
				<li>Stenogyne Kanehoana</li>
				<center><img src="Images/Kanehona.jpg" height="400" width="600" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>This member of the mint family was said to be extinct in 2000, until one sighting of a plant confirmed it was still alive. Growing only in the Waianae Mountains of the island of Oahu, the stegyne kanehoana has dense, furry leaves. In 2001 in the Lyon Arborteum, it was discovered that cuttings of this plant can be grown sucessfully in captivity.</p>
