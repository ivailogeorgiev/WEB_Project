				<h2><li>Madagascar Big-headed Turtle</li>
				<center><img src="Images/Turtle.jpg" height="400" width="600" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>The Madagascan big-headed turtle is a unique and prehistoric reptile. The species is endemic to lowland waterways and wetlands of western Madagascar, where adults feeds upon molluscs and plants and scavenges dead animals. As its name suggests, this turtle has a particularly large head relative to its body. Due to its colouration, it can sometimes appear to have large plates of gold armouring its over-sized head and body.</p>	
				<li>Gulbaru Gecko</li>
				<center><img src="Images/Gekon.jpg" height="400" width="600" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>This family of Australian geckos is ancient. They diverged from all other living reptiles more than 60 million years ago.The total area in which the gulbaru gecko species lives is only 23 km2. Their habitat is severely fragmented meaning there is little migration between populations. There are two disjunct and isolated populations, one around Palm Tree Creek and another by a tributary of the Black River.</p>
				<li>Uroplatus guentheri</li>
				<center><img src="Images/Gushter.jpg" height="400" width="600" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>The genus Uroplatus diverged from all other living geckos more than 50 million years ago, long before our ancestors diverged from those of modern baboons, tamarins and capuchin monkeys!Uroplatus guentheri is threatened by habitat loss and degradation due to fires, livestock, logging, charcoal production, and agricultural practices. It is listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List due to its small range, fragmented population and loss of suitable habitat.</p>
				<li>Mount Inago Pygmy Chameleon</li>
				<center><img src="Images/Chameleon.jpg" height="400" width="600" style="border-radius: 10px"></center>
				<p>The Mount Inago Pygmy Chameleon is found on Mount Inago in Mozambique where the major threat facing it is habitat fragmentation from land clearance for agriculture and selective logging for hardwoods by local communities. The total area of these forest patches is only 5 km2. This species is a forest specialsit and as such cannot pass between these fragmented forest areas. Given the intense pressure on the habitat and the assumed loss of ecological function of the remaining forest fragments, there is a possibility that species may even be extinct.</p>
